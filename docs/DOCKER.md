# Docker Setup üêã

## Requirements

* Docker
* `docker-compose`

## Setup

* `mv docker/docker-compose.yml .`
* Configure `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`
* `docker-compose up`

The Container is always built during runtime - there is no DockerHub repo to pull images from directly.

## Administration

The container exposes two ports: `5901 (VNC)` and `6901 (noVNC)`

You can access the container's Xserver (Desktop) using VNC or via noVNC, which is essentially a web-based VNC client.
Simply connect to `<ip-addr>:6901` and enter the `VNC_PASSWORD` previously specified. The preconfigured password is
`CHANGEME`.

Reminder: If you're running Docker on a VPS or another remote system, you can forward the port after setting 
`AllowTcpForwarding yes` and `GatewayPorts yes` in your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Forward the remote port via:
`ssh -L 6901:localhost:6901 root@domain.tld` and access the VNC interface on `127.0.0.1:6901` in your web browser.
